My attempt at building realtime blackhole ray tracer, 
reproducing [[1]](http://rantonels.github.io/starless/) and [[2]](https://github.com/oseiskar/black-hole).  
They helped me a lot because I had zero knowledge to begin with.  

I was fascinated by the idea of ray tracing blackhole with now popularized accretion disk around it. So I hopped in.  
 
### Features

- Left click your mouse drag to look around.
- Adjust quality for more accurate ray marching.
- Adjust bloom effect for aesthetics
- Can save as an image, allows higher resolution rendering.
- Custom Camera(Observer)
  - Orbit around the blackhole
  - Adjust field of view and distance
- Physics
  - Lorentz transform
  - Doppler shift
  - Relativistic beaming
  - Accretion disk
  - Background star color from blackbody spectrum (random and trivial velocity for red shift)
  
  
this may be a work-in-progess project(?).

### Maybe
- Add fog effect

--------------------

## How it was built

- Learn how to do basic ray tracing (ex: sphere)
- Think in light's perspective (ex: raymarching)
- Apply Camera concept to shader
- Learn a bit about various physical phenomena involving light and blackhole
- Scrutinize available resources, steal(?) mathematical formulas from gathered resources because I am not a physics genius.
- Apply equations to shader.
